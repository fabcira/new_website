  <p style='text-align:justify'>One studentships is available to work on  Web-related techniques for Knowledge Management. The projects will concern study, development and application of <strong>Semantic Web</strong> methodologies and are likely to be associated to some more general work done in cooperation with large companies in the fields of aerospace and/or pharmaceutical research.</p> 
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Applications are welcome from people with an education in computer science, with at least a 2:1 degree (or equivalent).&nbsp; We expect the candidates to have good track record, including excellent programming skills in Java and Web technologies. We look for people highly motivated in doing research at the highest levels and in entering a multidisciplinary team.Knowledge of Information Extraction from Text, Machine Learning, Human Computer Interaction and Natural Language Processing are definite advantages.</p>
