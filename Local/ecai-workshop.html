<h2>
<a NAME="Workshop Description"></a>Workshop Description</h2>
The exponential increase in the quantity of&nbsp; textual information held
in digital archives has fuelled growing interest in computer-assisted techniques
for information extraction&nbsp; from text (IE).&nbsp; IE systems, as understood
by the applied natural language processing community, identify predetermined
relevant information in text documents from some specific domain. Once
extracted, the information can be used for a number of purposes: database
population, text indexing, information highlighting, and so on. While significant
progress in constructing such systems has been made, stimulated in particular
by the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences, by general agreement the
main barriers to wider use and commercialisation of IE are the difficulties
in adapting systems to new applications and domains. Porting IE systems
is generally both difficult and expensive, given the current technology,
since changes generally need to be carried out manually by highly skilled
experts. Moreover some sources (e.g. Web pages) may change very rapidly
in both format and content. Tracking all the changes and continuously re-adapting
IE systems is very expensive or even unfeasible if done manually.
<br>To address these difficulties there has been increasing interest in
applying machine learning (ML) techniques to Information Extraction from
text. Tasks to which ML has been applied include template design, template
filling, named entity recognition and resource compilation (e.g. lexicons,
knowledge structures, grammars). The kind of sources analysed range from
structured texts (e.g. Web pages) to semi-structured texts (e.g. rental
ads) to free texts (e.g. newspaper articles). ML techniques which have
been used range from symbolic (e.g. inductive logic programming, transformation-based
learning, etc.) to numerical methods (e.g. naive-Bayes, maximum entropy,
etc.).However, the current situation is characterized by isolated experiments
in which individual ML techniques are applied to specific IE tasks. What
is lacking is a unifying view of the issue of adopting ML techniques for
IE.
<h3>
<a NAME="Aim of the workshop"></a>Aim of the workshop</h3>
The proposed workshop aims to establish a forum for discussing current
and future trends of the application of ML to IE, with a specific focus
on the identification of a unifying view of the issue. The workshop has
the following goals:
<ul>
<li>
to bring together communities of researchers that address the ML for IE
problem from different perspectives (e.g., natural language processing,
information retrieval, machine learning, information integration);</li>

<li>
to deepen the European IE community's understanding of the state of the
art;</li>

<li>
to identify further IE-related problems for which ML techniques might be
appropriate.</li>
</ul>
Particularly welcomed are contributions concerning:
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;descriptions of techniques adaptable for different languages, tasks
and/or text typologies;</li>

<li>
proposals of unifying views on the current or future application of ML
to IE.</li>
</ul>
In the interest of promoting as much discussion as possible, the number
of paper presentations will be limited in favour of panels and posters.
A final panel will discuss the research agenda for the coming years.
