Information Extraction is an automatic method for locating important facts in electronic documents for successive use, e.g. for document annotation or for information storing. It is a key technology for the development of the Semantic Web. Amilcare is an Adaptive Information Extraction tool designed to support document annotation. It is designed to be used by a wide range of users from naive users to Information Extraction experts. It can handle a range of text document types (e.g. free texts, HTML documents, XML documents, tables etc.) including documents which contain a mix of these features and it can be inserted into a wider annotation environment. Amilcare uses machine learning to adapt to new application domains, learning a set of rules. Rules are learnt by generalising over a set of examples in a training corpus annotatates with XML tags.
