<h2>Abstract</h2>
  LearningPinocchio is an algorithm  for adaptive information extraction.  It
  learns template filling rules that  insert  SGML tags into texts.  
  LearningPinocchio is based  on a covering algorithm   that learns rules  by
  bottom-up generalization of  instances  in a tagged corpus.  It  has
  been tested on three scenarios in  informal domains in two languages
  (Italian and  English).   Experiments report  excellent  results with
  respect to the current state of the art.
