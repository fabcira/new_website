<h2>Abstract</h2>
This    paper describes  an   advanced system   for multilingual  text
classification adaptable to different user needs.  The system has been
initially developed  as  an applied  research  project involving  both
research centres,  industrial bodies and  end-user organisations.  The
project was a considerable success story in  the     financial  field.
Three  different successful applications were released at the users' 
site involved in the project. Moreover the system was adopted by the  
main Italian financial news agency where it is used  to provide 
classified  news for an  external pay-to-view service.  
The system  has been running continuously  since January 1998.   
Its architecture integrates  modules  based on both some
innovative artificial intelligence methodologies and commercial tools.
In our opinion this   shows  that state-of-the-art AI  techniques  are
mature enough to provide real world applications.
