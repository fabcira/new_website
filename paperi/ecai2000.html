<h2>Abstract</h2>
Pinocchio  is   an environment   for  developing  Information
  Extraction  applications.  New   applications and  languages  can be
  covered  by  just  writing declarative  resources.    Information is
  represented uniformly throughout  the architecture: all the modules use
  the same  input  structure and   the same   type of declarative
  resources. Modules are implemented via the same basic processors and
  share a common environment for resource development  and debugging. The
  result  is  an  environment  easy to  use with limited
  training and skills.
