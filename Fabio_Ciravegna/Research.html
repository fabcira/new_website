        <h3>Application areas and success stories:<br/></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sensing via mobile phones, wearables and low cost architectures. I have developed:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Tracking via Mobile Phones: I have created a human mobility tracking technology with
                        around
                        900,000 downloads in the UK, used for supporting governmental campaigns for health
                        and wellbeing, as well as to understand mobility in large metropolitan areas. For
                        example this wass used for three years
                        in <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/active10/home">Active 10</a> on behalf of Public
                        Health England. This was an app and a large scale server infrastructure designed to collect
                        sub-minute
                        tracking data from over 900,000 users.
                        The same tracking technology was used by the Birmingham City Council to track thousands
                        of free bikes with the <a href="http://setamobility.org">Seta App</a>.
                        It was also used by <a href="http://www.movemoresheffield.com/">MoveMore </a> a project
                        that aims to make Sheffield the city in the Uk that "moves more" by 2020.
                        Currently the technology has been released to our new spin out <a href="aeqora.com"
                                                                                          target="_blank">Aeqora</a> and
                        implemented into:

                                hospitals in

                        EyesOnTheGround: a method to turn any citizen camera into a camera for the emergency
                        control room.
                        The citizen will receive a text message with a link. Clicking on the link will share the
                        camera with the control room. The control room will be able to
                        communicate with the citizen via bidirectional audio, control the citizen phone
                        (switching between front and back camera), identifying the exact citizen position via
                        the phone GPS,
                        as well as recording the video interaction and taking screenshots and notes. For
                        situation where installation
                        of an app in advance is feasible, I have developed also the corresponding Android and
                        iOS apps. This technology is now finding
                        application in hospitals to support occupational therapists.
