        Here you can find the open positions. You are very welcome to enquiry about any of them but I would be grateful if you could read  <a href="./Emailing.html">these tips</a> before contacting me.<br/>
        <!--<ul>-->
            <!--&lt;!&ndash;<li><b>Academic Positions</b>: these are positions as faculty</li>&ndash;&gt;-->
            <!--<li><b>PhD Positions</b>: these are positions for studying as a full time (or part-time) student. I am always very happy to receive applications from perspective students. However studying at the university costs unfortunately quite a bit of money. Students must be sure to have the required financial support. Sometimes we have available studentships. If we do, they are listed on this page. Some students instead have their own means (e.g. personal funds or grants from different institutions, e.g. national bodies, especially non-European bodies). Whatever your situation, make sure you consider carefully this issue. If you contact me for becoming a student, please let me know what situation applies to you in your email.</li>-->
            <!--&lt;!&ndash;<li><b>Research Positions</b>: these are for getting a job at the University of Sheffield. Postholders will become employees of the University of Sheffield and will receive a salary. Any employee of the University can study as a part time PhD while in post and no fees are due (However please consider that some positions require a PhD as entry requirement). </li>&ndash;&gt;-->

            Available PhD Student Projects
        </h2>


        <p>I have a range of dissertations available for an early 2020 start (February) or Late 2020 (October) and later.</p>
        <p>They concern the study of human mobility using mobile devices. We have developed applications tracking human mobility (either active or motorised) that have been downloaded by nearly a million users, including Active 10 for Public Health England, SETA, adopted by the City Council of Birmingham for their thousands of free bikes, MoveMore in Sheffield and many others.</p>
        <p>Activity has been funded by the <a href="www.setamobility.eu"> European Project SETA</a> that I have coordinated and it is continuing within the <a href="http://www.mobilise-d.eu/"> MobiliseD EU project</a>.</p>
        <p>The proposed projects have no funding. The University of Sheffield offer bursaries for outstanding students (open competition). Students with own funds are welcome.</p>

        <p>There are several directions of research:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing online methods and algorithms for tracking mobility with a particular focus on tracking and analysing contextual information (e.g. geolocation at high precision, intensity of activity - cadence, effort, etc.). Algorithms must work on large number of Android devices (there are over 10,000 Android devices) using very limited battery. More sophisticated algorithms can then be studied to be run on servers. The main focus of the project is working at very large scale. Requirements: excellent MSc (or equivalent 4/5 years degree) in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Solid knowledge of Software Engineering is required.</li>
            <li>Mobile tracking for health applications. A number of areas of medicine are interested in tracking patients after interventions or hospital admissions. The goal of the project will be to develop algorithms and methodologies for tracking patients using mobiles and wearables over long term (e.g. 1 year) with a particular focus on modelling lifestyle before and after intervention. Areas of application that may be considered are cardiovascular diseases and hip replacements. Requirements: excellent MSc (or equivalent 4/5 years degree) in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Solid knowledge of Software Engineering is required.</li>
            <li>Understanding mobility in metropolitan areas over large scale: we have collected over a billion data points of geolocated movements (time, geolocation, means of transport/movement, intensity, etc.). The goal of the project will be to analyse the data to answer questions related to trajectories modelling, stay points analysis, lifestyle modelling, etc.
                Requirements: excellent MSc (or equivalent 4/5 years degree) in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Solid knowledge of Software Engineering is required.
            </li>
            <li>Human mobility is a well studied subject in many ways: psychologists, doctors, sports experts, etc. have analysed the matter in many ways and under  many circumstances. The widespread availability of mobile phones and wearable devices (e.g. smart watches) with their ability to track every minute of our lives opens amazing opportunities. This project will be mainly experimental and explore the use of mobiles and wearables for tracking. How precise are movements tracked using consumer devices? What is the variance across devices? What is the level of acceptance by users in e.g. the medical domain (patients)? How do users carry mobiles (e.g. in tight/wide trousers pockets, bags, etc.) and what is the effect on tracking? Requirements: an MSc  (or equivalent 4/5 years degree) in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Studies or Psychology and a passion for experimental research. Good to excellent programming capabilities are a must (R, Matlab, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am happy to consider other proposals in the area of tracking or understanding mobility.</p>
