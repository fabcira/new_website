                I grew up in North Western Italy, lived in several places until I
                moved to the UK a dozen years ago.<br/>
                I am an academic; most of my time is spent doing research. I work on large-scale information
                management,
                an area that sounds terribly boring until you discover that my job lets me fly drones and go to
                music festivals for free.
                <br/>
                I also teach awfully bright students at the University of Sheffield. I teach advanced Web
                Technologies, another topic that looks horribly boring until you discover it is about doing cool
                things with Twitter and Facebook.
                <br/>Some of my undergrads have won competitions and even presented their results to the Prime
                Minister.
                Some of them have become PhD students and now are academics or researchers themselves. Others after
                their PhDs
                have become CEOs/CTOs and Chief Officers of companies we have created together. That probably means that
                I am old, because only old people can boast about the great achievements that their children have in
                life.
                <br/>My passions is to work with mobile architectures and wearables to track human mobility. I have developed apps that have been downloaded nearly 900,000 times.
                My research page detail these.
                I also have <a href="http://fabcirablog.weebly.com/">a personal blog</a> where I describe some
                of the things I do. It is rather limited because it is just related to personal rather than professional interests, but you can find it useful.
                <br/>I do quite a bit of travelling for work. Lately I have been to Australia
                (Melbourne and Sydney) and Dublin (Ireland), Bologna (Italy), Venice (Italy) and Ireland (again).
                <br/>If I do not reply to your emails, you know why.
                <br/>Oh, and in case you are wondering: I am dyslexic. This is why there are mistakes on these pages.
                Dyslexia is sometimes a hindrance but helps me think differently. These occasional stumblings taught me
                to fly.
                <br/>
